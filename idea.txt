Running out of space
--------------------

Tetris?
	Gamespace get smaller
	But how do we make the game playable and fun, and how does this affect the blocks?
	
	Bottom of screen keeps moving up.
	When a tile gets completly blocked it is unavailable.
	
	Clearing a line pushes the "dark" down 1 tile
	Clearing a tetris removes all the dark

You are clearing the sewer
Use your mystical abilities to clear the sewer before it overflows.

Clearing a line, magically clears 2 lines of sewer
Clearing a tetris, magically blocks the storm drain for a while

Occaisional huge "dumps"
 - Can you do poop particles
 - Can flush up at the bottom of the playfield, pushing other tiles out of the way
 - Maybe not push tiles, but definetly add a sound and send the particles from the left pipe,
   spreading them out from there with the origin

Move, check valid,
Rotate check valid,
repeat

Sewer Control: The Age of Poop


Fail line = 17

Have the menu be on the city from top.png
 - Need to create this

Then have the start menu be at the top and pan down to the game when we want to play

---

TODO:
 - Floating poop particles, remeber to offset for menuOffset, directional bounes, Use a clip rect
 
 If time:
 - Title falls in, bouncing would be cool
 - Funk up the title image
 - Juice it up, explode lines

Sewer Control started out as a simple intepretation of of the theme.
Tetris, a game where you are already running out of space, but with yet another challenge. Sewer!

You are a mysterious person that have the ability to clear out sewer playing
tetris with mysterious squishy blocks that somehow make their way down tha manholes.

Use your abilities to protect the people on the streets.

Gameplay
========

While you are fighting the falling pieces,
you also have to battle the sewage clogging up.
To fight back clear lines. Clearing 4 lines will clear all the sewage.

While the game is a rather simple twist on tetris I had a great time making it
,and I am already looking forward to the next LD where
I get some sort of idea/actually have time to do it

Controls:
=========
- Esc        - Pause
- Up         - Rotate
- Down       - Soft landing
- Left/Right - Move piece left/right
- Space      - Hard landing
- C          - Hold item


What I used:
============
- C
- SDL2,image,mixer
- Aseprite
- Sfxr
